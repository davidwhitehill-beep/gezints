Gezint Sisterhood 1818 — Match-3 (HTML5) v3

Fixes / adds:
- FIX: tiles no longer stay invisible after clears/falls (clearing animation no longer 'sticks')
- Match SFX: plays a random sound on each clear (after you press Play once, audio is enabled)

Audio files included:
- happy hannukah.mp3
- yiddish-ayyayyay.mp3
- yiddish-oyvey.mp3
- yiddish bass.mp3
- shalom.mp3


v4 add:
- Detects when there are no legal moves and auto-shuffles to restore playability.


v5 changes:
- 8 random icon types per game (picked on each new game)
- No auto-shuffle; user has 3 shuffles via Shuffle button
- No-move state plays oyvey; if no moves and no shuffles left, shows bubkes + plays ayyayyay
- Match sounds: big SFX only every 4th/5th clear from shalom/yiddish bass/happy hannukah; otherwise a short tone
